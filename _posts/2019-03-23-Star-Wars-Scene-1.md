I want to start by simply showing Scene 1 in its entirety before dissecting it. This is simply a masterpiece.

The scene starts off with John William's thunderous Main Theme performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. The theme was intentionally written in B# to match with the 20th Century Fox Fanfare, and this provides a seemless transition between the film's intro and the first true scene. I can't imagine SW being as successful a movie with William's deft touch. 

As the Main Theme catapults us out of our seats, we go from a blank black background to a star field with the now iconic Star Wars logo. Created by Suzy Rice and modified by Dan Perri and Joe Johnston, the logo retreats onscreen into the star field. It's a simple icon (No Episode IV, no A New Hope). Just clear, concise design that pulls us into space:

As the logo retreats into space, solid yellow text starts to crawl, setting the groundwork for the story Lucas is presenting us:

The first paragraph recounts a Rebel victory against the Empire. Dan Perri came up with the idea for the crawl after viewing *Union Pacific*'s opening titles[^1], and Brian De Palma reportedly helped polish the text to make the movie more clear to the audience.

The second paragraph sets up the movie's MacGuffin; the Death Star plans that just might tip the balance of power. We also learn how powerful the Death Star is, a fact that takes the movie's main characters awhile to grasp.

Finally we learn of Princess Leia, and the peril she faces. 

It takes Lucas almost 90 seconds to convey this, but most of this is simply to allow the audience enough time to actually read the crawl. When watched with fresh eyes, it's remarkable how succinct the crawl is. An evil Empire, planet destroying space stations, civil war, hidden bases, Rebel spaceships, and 'sinister agents'. Audience's in 1977 weren't used to this type of movie. The Flash Gordon/Buck Rogers era was over 30 years in the past, and no one was prepared for the impact of Star Wars. Whether Lucas planned for the crawl from the beginning, or if it was suggested by the coterie of filmmakers who comprised his inner circle, the crawl was essential in prepping the audience for the action to come.
