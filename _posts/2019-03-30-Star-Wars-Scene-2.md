“It was a vast, shining globe and it cast a light of lambent topaz into space – but it was not a sun” [^1]

There's so much to talk about in this scene! First we experience what would come to be Lucas's signature opening camera move; a tilt down from the starfield. Camera moves in FX were integral to the goal of immersing the audience in a believable yet fantastic world. Some moves were obvious, like this tilt, but others were far more subtle. As we pan down, we see two moon above a planet. The far moon might actually be a planet, but I think both are moons since they'd be too close to Tatooine to survive the planet's gravitational pull. As we tilt down further, we see Tatooine proper.

Tatooine's atmosphere is visible, as are the swirls of its topography. We don't have much time to contemplate its harsh beauty before we see a spaceship immediately enveloped in laser fire as it struggles to escape its pursuer. It's a good five seconds before we see what is chasing the Rebel Blockade Runner (also referred to as the Tantive IV).

Now we see why the Blockade Runner is fleeing. The Imperial Star Destroyer appears overhead, and continues until it fills the screen. Utterly dominating!

Notice how the shot transitions from moving left to right, as the perspective seemlessly shifts to a distant vanishing point.

The craftsmanship on the Star Destroyer is amazing. Notice the detail of the loading bay, especially how well lit it is. The surface detail is outstanding.

The engine lighting is perfect with natural lens flare that would make JJ Abrams envious.

Next we have a reverse shot where we can see the two ships trading laser blasts. Notice the slight pan left as the ships traverse from right to left. Watch the Blockade Runner's radar dish rotation. In this first shot, it's rotating counter-clockwise.

The Blockade Runner is outgunned by its pursuer, and gamely tries to fight but it's clearly a futile battle.

The Star Destroyer finally lands a lethal blow that cripples the Tantive IV. Look again at the radar dish rotation; it's been reversed (hat tip to Todd Vaziri [^2]). There's also a slight pan left again that reinforces the ship's movement in space.
  

This scene required so much effort to pull off successfully. Conceptually, we needed the general scene design from Lucas. Next we needed ship designs first from Colin Cantwell, Ralph McQuarrie, and Joe Johnston. Alex Tavoularis, Carl Myers, and Johnston then melded these into storyboards for the actual shooting. 

For the FX ILM needed the starfield, created by Joe Johnston.[^3] Johnston did this on 4x8 sheets of plexiglass, painted black, and backlit. Each star was created painstakingly by hand. Next it needed a matte painting of the two moons and Tatooine. These were probably done Ralph McQuarrie, though Harrison Ellenshaw also created a large number of mattes for the film's production. 

Ship models also needed to be crafted. Two different scale Blockade Runners and the Star Destroyer needed to be built. Grant McCune, Bill and Jamie Shourt, and Lorne Peterson as well as other model makers were instrumental in creating sophisticated models. 

We also need exquisite sound production; both John William's score, and Ben Burtt's sound FX. Whether it was the rumble of the Star Destroyer's engines, or the sounds of the laser blasts being exchanged, Burrt's creativity was showcased from the very start of the film.

Then the camera work. By the time this scene was shot (it was one of the last), John Dykstra had created a motion control camera that gave him and Richard Edlund the ability to do multiple passes with different models so that the optical printers could combine the separate footage accurately. Rotoscoped lasers and explosions were added at this point, as was the final real explosion when the Blockade Runner takes a direct hit.


Watching this mp4 on a monitor really doesn't do it justice. The low bass rumble of the Imperial Star Destroyer as it chases the Tantive IV, the scale of the Star Destroyer, overwhelming both the screen and the fleeing Rebel ship. Imagine the impact of seeing this on a 65ft wide screen as people went absolutely crazy. Now most viewers watch it on a small TV and don't get the full experience. Perhaps Disney will re-release the Original Trilogy in a theatrical run so this generation can enjoy it the same way viewers did in 1977.
