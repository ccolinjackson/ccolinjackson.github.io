I love movies, and this is a simple project to break down some of my favorite films scene by scene. I'm starting with Star Wars. Needless to say, all artwork here is property of Lucasfilm/Disney. This site is intended for educational purposes. Thanks for everyone involved in the creation of Star Wars!
