The experience of going to the movies has changed dramatically since Star Wars was released in 1977. Typically audiences would be shown a few trailers, then dive right into the movie. Today's experience is different; viewers are bombarded by ads, admonishments to turn off cellphones, and seemingly twice the number of previews. Once the movie actually starts, there are title cards from every production house involved, the distributor, the movie's title, the major cast and crew. While some directors use a clever montage to mask some of the tedium, most of it is just filler. 

In creating Star Wars, George Lucas wanted to chart a different course. Gone are any credits (saved for the end of the movie). Instead we're given a minimalistic introductory scene; the 20th Century Fox studio animation, a title card for Lucasfilm, and then a prologue. 

Here are the individual stills:

First we hear Alfred Newman's 20th Century Fox Fanfare, then fade in from black to the animated studio logo. This first element is often overlooked, but I think the 20th Century Fox intro is important not for the logo/searchlight animation but for Alfred Newman's fanfare. The rolling percussion followed by the orchestra's brass leads into a swelling string section lending a sense of grandeur. This fanfare was written in B#, and continues into the second element of the title scenes while the 20th Century Fox logo fades to black.

The second title element is a fade in to Lucasfilm's original logo, crisply rendered in green using what appears to be the Franklin Gothic Demi font. In future movies, this logo would be prettied up with flares and a rolling highlight. I prefer the original in it's spartan form. As soon as the fanfare ends, this logo fades to black.

Finally we silently fade in to the now iconic "a long time ago...". In soft blue text Lucas juxtaposes two ideas: time and location. The first is likening the movie to a fairy tale set in the past, the second implying a more scientific/modern bent by mentioning a galaxy "far, far away". This subconsciously broadens the expecations of the viewer.

Here's a video of the full intro scene:

I love this intro, especially compared to it's modern day counterparts. 42 years after first watching Star Wars, I still get goosebumps when I hear the fanfare kick in. It's unfortunate that Episode VI and VII don't include the fanfare. Perhaps with Disney's purchase of 20th Century Fox they'll include it in Episode VIII and add it back to the previous two for future releases. I won't even comment here on Rogue One and Solo except to say "you only get one chance to make a first impression...""
